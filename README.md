Im'm Konerai, network programmer base in Russia.

I create software for network packet sniffing and network monitoring.

My main tech stack libpicap and tcpdump. My favorite programming languages ​​are C/C++ and a little Python.

In my free time, I program well-known mathematical encryption algorithms (RSA, Magma) and like to implement large equations in one line of Python.

Fun fact:
 -Python is the best calculator in the world. Try changing my mind 😆
